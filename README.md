# STL Containers

In this repository, I have implemented the following containers from the standard STL library:

- `array`: Implementation of the array class with a fixed size.
- `containers`: Implementation of containers from the STL library.
- `containersplus`: Extended implementations of containers from the STL library.
- `list`: Implementation of a doubly-linked list.
- `map`: Implementation of the Map container, which represents a mapping of keys to values.
- `multiset`: Implementation of the Multiset container, which represents an ordered set of values.
- `queue`: Implementation of the Queue container, which represents a queue.
- `set`: Implementation of the Set container, which represents an ordered set of unique values.
- `stack`: Implementation of the Stack container, which represents a stack.
- `vector`: Implementation of the Vector container, which represents a dynamic array.

Each container has its own features and is suitable for different tasks. I have tried to implement these containers taking into account their main functions and capabilities.

## Usage

You can use these containers by including the corresponding header file and creating an instance of the desired container. Then, you can use the methods and operations of the container to add, remove, and access elements.
